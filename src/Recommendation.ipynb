       "\t\\hline\n",
       "\t1 & 3 & US & This spent 20 months in 30\\% new French oak, and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards, among others. Aromatic, dense and toasty, it deftly blends aromas and flavors of toast, cigar box, blackberry, black cherry, coffee and graphite. Tannins are polished to a fine sheen, and frame a finish loaded with dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now through 2032. & Reserve & 96 & 65.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Ponzi \\\\\n",
       "\t2 & 8 & US & This re-named vineyard was formerly bottled as deLancellotti. You'll find striking minerality underscoring chunky black fruits. Accents of citrus and graphite comingle, with exceptional midpalate concentration. This is a wine to cellar, though it is already quite enjoyable. Drink now through 2030. & Silice & 95 & 65.0 & Oregon & Chehalem Mountains & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Bergström \\\\\n",
       "\t3 & 11 & US & From 18-year-old vines, this supple well-balanced effort blends flavors of mocha, cherry, vanilla and breakfast tea. Superbly integrated and delicious even at this early stage, this wine seems destined for a long and savory cellar life. Drink now through 2028. & Estate Vineyard Wadensvil Block & 95 & 48.0 & Oregon & Ribbon Ridge & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Patricia Green Cellars \\\\\n",
       "\t4 & 12 & US & A standout even in this terrific lineup of 2015 releases from Patricia Green, the Weber opens with a burst of cola and tobacco scents and accents. It continues, subtle and detailed, with flavors of oranges, vanilla, tea and milk chocolate discreetly threaded through ripe blackberry fruit. & Weber Vineyard & 95 & 48.0 & Oregon & Dundee Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Patricia Green Cellars \\\\\n",
       "\t5 & 14 & US & With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral. All these elements are in good proportion and finish with an appealing silky texture. It's delicious already, but give it another decade for full enjoyment. Drink now through 2028. & Grace Vineyard & 95 & 185.0 & Oregon & Dundee Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Domaine Serene \\\\\n",
       "\t6 & 15 & US & First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028. & Sigrid & 95 & 90.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Chardonnay & Bergström \\\\\n",
       "\t7 & 26 & US & Bergström has made a Shea designate since 2003, intent on showcasing a “pretty” style of the vineyard. Here are lovely aromatics, with grape jelly, rose petals and plum in the nose, and a complex run of red fruits in the mouth. Streaks of cola, brown sugar and more come up in a generous finish. & Shea Vineyard & 94 & 62.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley &  & Pinot Noir & Bergström \\\\\n",
       "\t8 & 27 & US & Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50\\% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression. & Abetina & 94 & 105.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Ponzi \\\\\n",
       "\t9 & 68 & US & Big, bold, dark and chewy, this builds upon substantial black-cherry fruit and supporting acids. Still knitting together, it shows highlights of cedar and tobacco, along with thick tannins. Give this a couple more years of bottle age, and drink after 2018. & Schindler Vineyard & 91 & 50.0 & Oregon & Eola-Amity Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Panther Creek \\\\\n",
       "\t10 & 73 & US & Massively fruity, this is an apple/pear bonanza, fleshy and almost lasciviously delicious. The huge fruit flavors convey an impression of sweetness, though this is not identified as off dry. It has tremendous density and length. &  & 91 & 19.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Gris & Trinity Vineyards \\\\\n",
       "\t11 & 75 & US & An elegant blend from different estate vineyards, this widely available cuvée brings sturdy tannins and red currant fruit, highlighted with pretty baking spices. It would be an ideal match for roast duck with an orange sauce. & Premier Cuvée & 91 & 54.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Archery Summit \\\\\n",
       "\t12 & 80 & US & Generous black-cherry fruit anchors this barrel-aged wine that remains tartly acidic, with pretty accents of toast and mocha. Focused, young and fresh, it should drink optimally 2018–2028. & Aeolian & 91 & 42.0 & Oregon & Eola-Amity Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Bethel Heights \\\\\n",
       "\t13 & 143 & US & Estate grown and aged in Stainless steel, this racy and pungent wine is packed with rich, juicy fruit flavors. Apple, lemon-lime and tangerine are in the mix, showing that Chardonnay does not always need oak flavors to have real power. &  & 90 & 26.0 & Oregon & Applegate Valley & Southern Oregon & Chardonnay & Schmidt \\\\\n",
       "\t14 & 150 & US & Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish. &  & 89 & 50.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Bomb \\\\\n",
       "\t15 & 157 & US & In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7\\% Syrah, and aged in 30\\% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip. &  & 89 & 24.0 & Oregon & Rogue Valley & Southern Oregon & Sangiovese & Ledger David \\\\\n",
       "\t16 & 161 & US & A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability. &  & 89 & 35.0 & Oregon & Oregon & Oregon Other & Pinot Noir & Irvine Family Vineyards \\\\\n",
       "\t17 & 165 & US & Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short. & Freedom Hill Vineyard & 89 & 36.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Silvan Ridge \\\\\n",
       "\t18 & 246 & US & Toasty scents and flavors of the barrels (40\\% new) cloak tart raspberry fruit. It's clean and efficient, though for the moment at least, the barrel flavors outrun the rather light fruit. That can change over time, so give this one until 2015 or so in bottle. & Estate & 88 & 36.0 & Oregon & McMinnville & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Coeur de Terre \\\\\n",
       "\t19 & 252 & US & Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish. & Wits' End & 88 & 60.0 & Oregon & Chehalem Mountains & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Roco \\\\\n",
       "\t20 & 254 & US & This is a frizzante style of Muscat, the pressure slight enough to allow for a screwcap seal. Off-dry, spicy and aromatic, it's a great sipping wine, with concentrated flavors of sweet orange-pekoe tea. & Early & 88 & 15.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Muscat & Silvan Ridge \\\\\n",
       "\t21 & 289 & US & Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity. Entry is surprisingly soft, and (perhaps influenced by the name) there seems to be a pleasing clay-like quality to the mouthfeel. Clean blueberry fruit leads into a tasty, balanced finish. & Clay Court & 91 & 60.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Elk Cove \\\\\n",
       "\t22 & 292 & US & Sourced from the Chalice (estate) vineyard, this aromatic and seductive wine presents a compelling mix of tree fruits, racy acidity, and a rich, textural, open mouthfeel. The flavors of pears, orange peel and snappy spices linger deliciously through a long finish. &  & 91 & 16.0 & Oregon & Oregon & Oregon Other & Pinot Gris & Iris Vineyards \\\\\n",
       "\t23 & 306 & US & The estate's 13 acres were first planted in 1999. This lovely wine expresses itself with perfectly ripened black-cherry fruit, a dash of cola, and an underpinning of clean earth, complemented with a touch of mineral. The finish is superb. & Bergström Vineyard & 94 & 90.0 & Oregon & Dundee Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Bergström \\\\\n",
       "\t24 & 309 & US & There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish. & Evenstad Reserve & 94 & 70.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Domaine Serene \\\\\n",
       "\t25 & 314 & US & This gorgeous wine deftly integrates a lively mix of currant, cherry, breakfast tea and dried leaves into a seamless and seductive whole. Produced from vines dating back to the early 1970s, it finishes with a delicious streak of milk chocolate. Drink now through 2030. & Durant Vineyard Bishop Block & 94 & 48.0 & Oregon & Dundee Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Patricia Green Cellars \\\\\n",
       "\t26 & 317 & US & Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive. Dense with fruit and detailed with wet stone minerality, this should be cellared a few years, and consumed from 2020 to 2030. & Ribbon Ridge Estate & 94 & 49.0 & Oregon & Ribbon Ridge & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Trisaetum \\\\\n",
       "\t27 & 329 & US & Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30\\% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging. & Aurora Vineyard & 94 & 63.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Chardonnay & Ponzi \\\\\n",
       "\t28 & 337 & US & This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate. The berry/cherry fruit is nicely adorned with toasty barrel flavors, and it's as satiny as new sheets. You'll find it hard to keep from gulping this by the glassful. &  & 91 & 30.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & La Crema \\\\\n",
       "\t29 & 351 & US & A limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco. The pretty fruit leads into darker notes of tar and espresso. Still young and primary, the Juliard may be among the vintage's most long-lasting wines. & Juliard Vineyard & 91 & 48.0 & Oregon & Dundee Hills & Willamette Valley & Pinot Noir & Winderlea \\\\\n",
       "\t30 & 354 & US & Principally Pinot Noir, the blend includes 25\\% Pinot Meunier and a splash of Chardonnay. It's a light and pretty salmon pink in hue, with hints of honeysuckle and moist earth in the nose. Flavors suggest tart raspberries and Bing cherries, with impressive minerality in the crisp, lingering finish. & Brut Rosé & 91 & 50.0 & Oregon & Willamette Valley & Willamette Valley & Sparkling Blend & Argyle \\\\\n",
